# Email Spam Filter

#### Technology : Anaconda, Python
#### Duration   : Oct - Nov 16

### Description
1.	Built a spam filter using “spamassasin” dataset. 
2.	Extracted title and body from raw HTML formatted email.
3.	Extracted features for each email by vectorizing each email using two separate methods, counting-based vectorization  and tfidf-based vectorization.
4.	Evaluated the performance of spam filtering using the Naïve Bayes and logistic regression algorithms using 5-fold cross validation. 
5.	Reported the average and standard deviation of precision, recall and F1- scores for the following cases.
6.	Naïve Bayes (count vectorized and tf-idf vectorized) 
7.	Logistic regression with L2 regularization with C=1 and C=0.5 (count vectorized and tf-idf vectorized) 
8.	Logistic regression with L1 regularization with C=1 and C=0.5 (count vectorized and tf-idf vectorized)
